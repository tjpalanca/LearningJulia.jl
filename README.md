This package is just a container for all the code I write while trying to 
learn the Julia language.

I'm just writing bullet points and notes as a stream-of-consciousness, so 
this won't be particularly organized, but hopefully this will help other R 
users coming to Julia on what to watch out for and how well it might map
to similar workflows.

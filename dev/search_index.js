Although, the Language Server can  sometimes choke up for no apparent reason, and it takes a while for  autocomplete to kick in after loading a package using using.\nSome of the great features are on version control, particularly with the  Git Lens extensions. I can see how more software engineering-types will be  attracted to the Julia ecosystem compared to R which attracts domain  experts going in the opposite direction.\nI'm pretty sure I can find a VS code extension for anything I need; it's an  amazingly rich ecosystem!\nInline results are something else! Much better than a notebook interface and  better than also constantly looking at the console.","category":"page"},{"location":"dev_env/#OhMyREPL.jl","page":"Development Environment","title":"OhMyREPL.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"dev_env/","page":"Development Environment","title":"Development Environment","text":"That's cool!

Very little cognitive load on translating some work.\nHowever, the whole multiple dispatch thing, when I watch videos looks amazing, but when I try to implement makes my brain hurt. I suffer from the curse of seeing OOP in Python and R6 in R. S3 is quite similar but is so much  simpler because it's single dispatch.\nSymbols and strings are separate - amaze!

R's documentation system via  {roxygen2} is more restrictive and sometimes requires me to add a lot of  boilerplate. This one feels just right.\nOther packages have very scant package documentation.

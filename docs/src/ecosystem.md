# Package Ecosystem

* I'm spoiled by CRAN. It's a pain to submit and maintain but it does result 
  in such a good user experience.
* Pkg is a great package manager with environments built in! What a relief 
  as python's venv, conda, etc was difficult to grok.
* I'm seeing that the Pkg registration process is quite liberal, so now I'm 
  struggling to find a way to easily gate the quality of packages and the 
  updated-ness of packages I want to use.

# Generative Art

Something that coincideded with my desire to learn Julia was my desire to create
some generative art, so it would be awesome if I could marry the two and really
do some creative coding in Julia.

## Luxor.jl + Javis.jl

## Compose.jl

* Takes inspiration from R's `{grid}`
* `compose(a, b)` returns a new tree rooted at `a` with `b` as child.
* There is a [Forms gallery](https://giovineitalia.github.io/Compose.jl/latest/gallery/forms/#forms_gallery)
  a [Properties gallery](https://giovineitalia.github.io/Compose.jl/latest/gallery/properties/), and 
  a [Transforms gallery](https://giovineitalia.github.io/Compose.jl/latest/gallery/transforms/) that 
  are all pretty featured

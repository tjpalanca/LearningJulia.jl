# Documentation

Using: `Documenter.jl`

* I'm interested to see how well we can document stuff, and I'm going to 
  mainly use the package documentation feature to document my findings during
  this exploration.
* Seems pretty good so far! I really like the freeformness of the documentation
  that we can link to docstrings and such. R's documentation system via 
  `{roxygen2}` is more restrictive and sometimes requires me to add a lot of 
  boilerplate. This one feels just right.
* Other packages have very scant package documentation. This is an opportunity
  to start contributing!
